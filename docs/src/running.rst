Running the controller
======================

After you have :ref:`installed<installation>` the backend and the controller and edited the controller :ref:`configuration`, you can start the controller with ``npm run start`` (if cloning from the git repository) or just by running ``carta-controller`` (if installing from NPM). You can use a utility such as `forever <https://github.com/foreversd/forever>`_ or `pm2 <https://pm2.keymetrics.io/>`_ to keep the controller running.
